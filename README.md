# A blog on Mumbai
 I wanted to sum all my experiences from Mumbai into one website. So, I designed it with Notion and then exported to HTML to play with it. I got quite satisfied with result, so I went further and edited as per need and hosted using Vercel. This is just an experimental project, although I learned some HTML unique tags while doing it. I also realised both PROs and CONs of this deployment type.
